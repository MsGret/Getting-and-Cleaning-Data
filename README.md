# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This repository is a submission for Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* Course Project (week 4).

## Explanation of the files contents in the repo

`run_analysis.R` contains data cleaning by the 5 steps (described in the course projectâ€™s definition):
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

`CodeBook.md` describes all the variables and summaries calculated.

`tidyDataset` contains tidy data as result of analysis by `run_analysis.R`.
